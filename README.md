### Current/Recent Projects

I am currently on a sabbatical, working on personal projects (related to deep
learning), and occasionally consulting for bounded projects.

Here are some side projects I have built recently:

- [nbmetadata](http://github.com/indigoviolet/nbmetadata): Utility to manage Jupyter notebook metadata
- [torchprof](http://github.com/indigoviolet/torchprof): Profile PyTorch models
- [shapeguard](http://github.com/indigoviolet/shapeguard): Shape assertions for PyTorch
- [pytorch-summary](http://github.com/indigoviolet/pytorch-summary): Produce detailed summaries of PyTorch model shape, size, receptive field etc.
- [Coconotes](https://coconotes.romansix.org/): React Native app to take quick notes to self (and others)
- [mypy-missing-imports](http://github.com/indigoviolet/mypy-missing-imports): Handle missing imports in Mypy efficiently.
